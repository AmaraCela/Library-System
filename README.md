&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This project consists of a Library Management System, that is both fully operational, built in Java programming language, and contains a Graphical User Interface, achieved with Java FX. The system allows the registration of three types of users: the administrator, the managagers and the librarians.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The administartor makes up the highest user - level, meaning that he/she has access to all the features that are granted to the other levels of users, and in addition to those he/she can also perform extra actions. Some of the exlusive features of this category are: registering, modifying and deleting librarians and managers,addding or removing priviledges from the subordinates, viewing the statisticts about the books sales. The other features of the administrators, as mentioned, are shared by the other levels of users as well. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Managers are responsible for entering, modifying and deleting books. They can also enter new categories of books in the library when needed. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Librarians can view the books that are available for sale, along with all the information regarding each of the books, as well as they can check out books, in which cases a cash receipt will be generated.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To run the code, a proper IDE that supports Java and JavaFX is needed.
